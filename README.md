# site-monitor
A simple program written in Python to monitor a web page for changes. Doesn't work with every single website, but with simpler websites it should be fine. We used Weebly to test.

## Setup
- $ pip install beautifulsoup4
- $ pip install requests
- $ pip install lxml


## Further dependencies (should be installed by default):
- time
- difflib
